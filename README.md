# telegram-bot-gscript
Example script for Google Scripts, to send messages to your Telegram bot.

The script replies to you with your own message, sticker or image. If you try to send another thing it will send "Try another stuff".

You will need to create your bot with Botfather in Telegram, take the API key and replace it in main.gs where it says YOUR-API-HERE.
